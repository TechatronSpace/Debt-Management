Debt management involves strategies and
practices for handling debt effectively to
improve financial stability. It includes
budgeting, prioritizing payments,
negotiating with creditors, and possibly
working with professional debt
management services. Here's a
comprehensive guide to debt
management:

Personal loan/Debt consolidation
loan

A personal loan is a type of installment loan
that provides a lump sum of money, which
you repay over a fixed period with interest.
Personal loans are typically unsecured,
meaning they don't require collateral like a
car or house.

A debt consolidation loan is a type of loan
that combines multiple debts into a single,
larger piece of debt, usually with more
favorable payoff terms such as a lower
interest rate, lower monthly payment, or both.
